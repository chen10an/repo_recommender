# repo_recommender
A small recommendation system for GitHub repositories based on collaborative filtering.

Notebook for creating the dataset via GitHub's API and python's requests library:
[make dataset]()

Note: I have not included auth.py in this repo because it contains my login information.
The file can be created with this content:
```py
user = 'username'
pw = 'password'
```

Notebook that contains the recommendation system:
[Collaborative Filtering for GitHub Stars]()
* I have a more detailed notebook for the collaborative filtering algorithm [here][other repo].
